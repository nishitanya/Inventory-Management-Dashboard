This project provides an **Inventory Management Dashboard using Power BI**, designed for Warehouse and In-Plant Inventory Managers to effectively control inventory levels and maintain service levels.  


## Tools & Technologies  
- **Power BI** – Data visualization & dashboard creation  
- **Excel** – Data source  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Measures, calculated columns, and KPIs

## Key Components  
- **ABC Classification** – Identifies critical items based on revenue contribution (Pareto principle).  
- **XYZ Classification** – Categorizes items based on demand variability (uniform, variable, uncertain).  
- **Inventory Turnover Ratio** – Measures efficiency of inventory usage.  
- **Safety Stock Levels** – Ensures service level consistency under demand variability.  
- **Reorder Levels** – Estimated using average weekly demand + safety stock.
